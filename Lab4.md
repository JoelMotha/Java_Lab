DESCRIPTION

The code defines an abstract class Robber with methods for different robbing
scenarios (RowHouses, RoundHouses, SquareHouse, MultiHouseBuilding). A
concrete subclass JAVAProfessionalRobber implements these methods, using a
helper function to calculate the maximum money that can be robbed without
triggering alarms (by skipping adjacent houses). The program tests these
methods with various inputs, calculating and printing the maximum money that
can be robbed from a set of houses or buildings.
